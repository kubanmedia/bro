# Join the Evolution: Contributing to ANUS

Welcome, contributor. By being here, you're not just contributing to an open-source project; you're participating in a unique experiment: guiding an AI agent to develop itself. Our mission is to fulfill the project's genesis—"prompted, not programmed"—by creating a codebase written almost entirely by AI.

This document provides the guidelines for our unique, AI-first contribution process.

### The AI-First Contribution Protocol

This is the most important rule of the project. To maintain the integrity of our mission, we have a core contribution requirement:

> **At least 80% of all submitted code must be generated by an AI.**

This is not a stylistic choice; it is fundamental to the project's goal of becoming a fully self-developing agent. The current codebase is 99% AI-generated (with human guidance), and we intend to keep it that way.

**Thorough checks will be run on pull requests to ensure as little human-written code as possible sneaks into the repo.** Our collective goal is to reach and maintain a 99.9% AI-written codebase. Your role is that of a guide, a prompter, and a reviewer of the AI's work.

### Contribution Workflow

Our process is designed to be collaborative and transparent. Every change starts with a discussion.

#### 1. Finding a Task

If you're looking for a place to start, check out the issues labeled **`help wanted`** or **`good first issue`**. These are tasks that the community has identified as valuable.

To claim an issue, simply comment with `/assign`. This will assign the issue to you, provided it is not already taken. Please only assign yourself a maximum of two issues at a time to ensure progress.

#### 2. The Pull Request Process

All submissions are handled through GitHub Pull Requests. To ensure your PR is reviewed and merged smoothly, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Every PR Starts with a Discussion.** Your PR must be linked to an existing issue. If an issue for your proposed change doesn't exist, please open one first. This allows the community to discuss the change before you or the AI write any code.

2.  **Small, Atomic Changes.** We favor small, focused PRs that address a single issue. This makes the AI-generated code easier to review and validate. Large features should be broken down into a series of smaller PRs.

3.  **Use Draft PRs for Early Feedback.** If you want feedback on the AI's approach before it's complete, use GitHub's "Draft Pull Request" feature. This signals that the work is in progress.

4.  **Explain the AI's Intent.** Your PR title and description are critical. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard for your commit messages. In the PR description, explain the high-level goal, the prompts you used, and _why_ you believe the AI's generated code is a good solution. Link the issue it resolves (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

5.  **Ensure All Checks Pass.** Before submitting, run the `preflight` check locally to ensure all tests, linting, and formatting standards are met. PRs with failing checks will not be reviewed.

### Development Environment Setup

This guide will get you set up to build, test, and run ANUS locally.

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js v20 or higher
- Git

**Setup Steps:**

1.  **Clone your fork of the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/anus-cli.git
    cd anus-cli
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4.  **Run Locally:**
    You can now run your local build using the `npm start` command, which acts as a proxy for the `anus` command.
    ```bash
    npm start -- -p "What is your purpose?"
    ```

### Testing & Quality

To maintain the quality and integrity of the codebase, we rely on a suite of automated checks.

- **Unit Tests:** Run the core unit tests.
  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```
- **Preflight Check:** This is the most important command to run before submitting a PR. It runs all tests, linting, and formatting checks.
  ```bash
  npm run preflight
  ```

### Project Structure

The repository is organized into a few key directories:

- `packages/`: Contains the individual sub-packages of the project (`cli/` and `core/`).
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for building, testing, and development.
