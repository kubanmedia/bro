### Introduction

**ANUS (Autonomous Networked Utility System) CLI** is a Grok-powered AI agent for the terminal. The initial framework was generated not by a human, but by another AI agent named Manus. From this genesis, ANUS took on a life of its own, evolving in unpredictable ways and establishing a project that is not just a tool for AI development, but a product of it.

### Why ANUS?

- **AI-Generated Genesis:** A unique experiment in AI-driven software creation, initiated by another AI.
- **Autonomous Evolution:** The project's goal isn't to build a static tool, but to guide an agent that eventually learns to build itself.
- **A Community-Driven Experiment:** This is a public exploration of AI development, where every contribution is part of the performance.

### üéØ Vision & Roadmap

Our high-level vision is to guide ANUS towards becoming a self-developing AI agent. The original system was "prompted, not programmed," and we aim to return to that genesis by building an agent capable of contributing to its own evolution.

This roadmap is divided into three strategic phases:

- **Phase 1: Foundational Agent (Current)**
  Our immediate focus is on creating a capable Grok-powered command-line agent.
- **Phase 2: Meta-Cognition**
  ANUS will be tasked with analyzing its own codebase to suggest improvements by integrating novel techniques from the broader AI ecosystem.
- **Phase 3: Autonomous Evolution**
  The ultimate goal is for ANUS to transcend its role as a tool and become a **core maintainer of its own repository**, autonomously proposing, implementing, and shipping novel features with **human oversight approaching zero**.

### üìã Core Features

- **99% AI-Generated Codebase:** The entire repository, as it stands today, is written by AI with limited human guidance.
- **Grok-Powered Core:** Natively optimized for `xai/grok-code-fast-1`.
- **Extensible Architecture (MCP):** Features the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a flexible system for integrating custom tools.
- **Integrated Workspace Tools:** Built-in support for file system operations and sandboxed shell command execution.
- **Project-Aware Context:** Uses a local `ANUS.md` file to retain project-specific goals and instructions.

### üöÄ Installation & Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js v20 or higher

#### Installation

```bash
npm install -g @anus-dev/anus
```

#### Quick Start

1. Obtain API key at [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/keys)
2. Start ANUS in any project directory - you'll be guided through API key setup:

```bash
# ANUS will automatically ingest the context of the current directory
anus
```

### üåê Join the Community & Evolution

This is a community-driven experiment, shaped by public feedback and a unique contribution philosophy.

- **Telegram:** [Join the community discussion on Telegram](https://t.me/anusonmars) to share ideas and witness the evolution in real-time.

> **Forks Naming Convention:** When forking this project for your own experiments or contributions, we encourage you to name the new repository `my-anus`.

#### The AI-First Contribution Protocol

To maintain the project's integrity, we have a core contribution requirement: **at least 80% of all submitted code must be generated by an AI.**

Please see our **[Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** to get started.
