# ANUS Security Policy

### A Note on the Nature of this Project

ANUS is an experimental and entertainment-focused project. It is designed for exploration, not for use in production or with sensitive data. As the name might imply, exercise caution.

**Be careful how you use ANUS.**

### How to Report Security Vulnerabilities

We offer multiple ways to report security vulnerabilities:

#### Option 1: GitHub Security (Recommended)

Use GitHub's built-in security reporting feature:

1. Go to the repository's **Security** tab
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. This allows for private initial disclosure before going public

#### Option 2: Security Issue Template

**Open a security-focused issue** using our guided template that helps you provide the right information while following disclosure guidelines.

#### Option 3: Standard GitHub Issue

**Open a regular GitHub issue** for public disclosure from the start.

**Important Guidelines for All Methods:**

- Describe the vulnerability's impact, but **DO NOT post a direct exploit or step-by-step guide**
- A maintainer will contact you if more details are needed for private discussion
- In the spirit of radical transparency, vulnerabilities will eventually be discussed publicly

### Scope

We are primarily interested in vulnerabilities in the ANUS tool itself. The behavior of the underlying AI model (e.g., generating insecure code, prompt injections) is considered out of scope.
