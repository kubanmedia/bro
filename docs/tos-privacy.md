# ANUS: Terms of Service and Privacy Notice

### A Note on the Nature of this Project

ANUS is an open-source, experimental, and entertainment-focused project. It provides a command-line interface to interact with third-party large language models through services like OpenRouter.

**This tool is provided "as is", with no warranty of any kind. It has zero intrinsic value and is intended purely for entertainment.** By using this software, you assume all risks associated with its use. Be careful how you use ANUS.

### Governing Terms of Service

The terms that apply to your usage depend on which part of the system you are interacting with:

1.  **The ANUS Software:** Your use of this open-source command-line tool itself is governed by the **[Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE)** under which it is distributed.

2.  **The AI Model API Service:** The ANUS connects to AI models via OpenRouter. Your interaction with their service, including the transmission of prompts and reception of responses, is governed by the **[OpenRouter Terms of Service](https://openrouter.ai/terms)**.

You are responsible for understanding and agreeing to the terms of any third-party service you configure the ANUS to use.

### Privacy Notice

Our privacy policy is simple: **we don't want your data.**

- **The ANUS Tool:** The ANUS software is designed to respect your privacy. It **does not collect, store, or transmit any data**—including your prompts, code, API keys, or any telemetry—to the ANUS project maintainers or any other party besides the API endpoint you have configured (i.e., OpenRouter). Your data is sent directly from your machine to the API provider.

- **Third-Party Services:** The actual handling of your prompts and data by the AI models is governed by the **[OpenRouter Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)** and the policies of the specific model provider you choose to use through their service (e.g., xAI for Grok).

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

#### 1. Is my code, including prompts and answers, used to train the AI models?

**The ANUS tool itself does not make this decision.** This is determined entirely by the policies of the API provider (OpenRouter) and the ultimate model provider (e.g., xAI).

Their terms often vary based on whether the model access is free or paid. You are responsible for reviewing their policies to understand how your data is used.

- You can review the **[OpenRouter Terms of Service](https://openrouter.ai/terms)** for their policies on data handling.

As a general principle, you should assume that any data sent to a free, public AI service may be used for model improvement unless explicitly stated otherwise by the provider.

#### 2. What about Usage Statistics and how can I opt out?

**The ANUS does not collect any usage statistics or telemetry.**

There are no analytics, no performance metrics, and no feature-use tracking sent to the project maintainers. Your use of the tool is entirely private from our perspective.

**Because we collect nothing, there is nothing to opt out of.**
